  <p> In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content.</p>
 <h1>Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. </h1>
<h2>It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text influencing the design.</h2>
